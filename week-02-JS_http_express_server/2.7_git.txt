what's git?

its a free and open source version control system (VCS)
- a system that keeps track of our files or projects

Uses: we can compare, revert, see what is the issue, who made it and when was it made
move the project into stable version etc.

VCS are of 2 types : 
Centralized and Distributed

Centralized: all people can access from the Centralized server and collaborate to it.

if the server is down : everyone affects. okay for small project.


Distributed: we can checkout from the main by mirroring the full project and 
so we dont have to worry if 1 server goes down. they have full hisory of repo and changelog

ex. git, mercurial

we can keep commiting into local repo and need network only when we need to push it into
remote server

what is GitHub then?? - web based hosting service

we can use git without using github but we cant do vice-versa

Git provides a private local copy of the entire project with all the history


BLOB - binary large object. each version of the file is represented by a blob.

SHA1 is a hashing method to hash a file (encrypt a file)

Tree is an object which represents a directory.

Commit is like a node of a linked list
